### Hello\ 👋

My name is Mepuka Kessy and I'm a software engineer based in Seattle.

🔭 I'm currently diving deep into functional programming with the goal of fundamentally improving my approach to software design especially as applied to web development. Lately, I've been exploring the amazing [fp-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts) library and ecosystem that brings popular functional progamming patterns and abstractions to TypeScript. I've also started the exciting journey of learning λ Haskell λ.

Recently I've had fun incorporating functional programming techniques into React and other front-end frameworks.
