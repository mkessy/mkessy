### Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Mepuka Kessy and I'm a software engineer based in Seattle. (I'm looking for a new job. Please feel free to contact me.)

ðŸ”­ I'm currently diving deep into functional programming with the goal of fundamentally improving my approach to software design especially as applied to web development and backend engineering. Lately, I've been exploring the amazing [fp-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts) library and ecosystem that brings popular functional progamming patterns and abstractions to TypeScript.


Outside of coding I enjoy tinkering with my homemade e-bike, watching and playing soccer, reading about urbanism and politics, and cooking yummy food.
